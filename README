A port of gauth at https://github.com/pcarrier/gauth to Common LISP

Depends on Ironclad, cl-base32 and split-sequence.

Licensed under MIT, as per gauth.

It does not do Decryption naively, but instead invokes OpenSSL to do do decryption of file.
Unlike gauth, it will only read in decryption from ~/.config/gauth.csv.aes256 using AES256 not AES128.
